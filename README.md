# PromethAI-Memory
Memory management for the AI Applications and AI Agents

## The Motivation

Browsing the database of theresanaiforthat.com, we can observe around [7000 new, mostly semi-finished projects](https://theresanaiforthat.com/) in the field of applied AI, whose development is fueled by new improvements in foundation models and open-source community contributions.

It seems it has never been easier to create a startup, build an app, and go to marketâ€¦ and fail.

AI apps currently being pushed out still mostly feel and perform like demos.

To address this issue, [dlthub](https://dlthub.com/) and [prometh.ai](http://prometh.ai/) will collaborate on a productionizing a common use-case, progressing step by step. We will utilize the LLMs, frameworks, and services, refining the code until we attain a clearer understanding of what a modern LLM architecture stack might entail.
