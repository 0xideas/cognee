Our dogs, in particular, have been an acceptable outlet for emotions and impulses we otherwise keep strictly controlled – our latent desire to be demonstratively affectionate, to be silly and chat to strangers. If this seems like an exaggeration, consider the different reactions you’d get if you struck up a conversation with someone in a park with a dog, versus someone on the train.\n",
    "Indeed, British society has been set up to accommodate these four-legged ambassadors. In the UK – unlike Australia, say, or New Zealand – dogs are not just permitted on public transport but often openly encouraged. Many pubs and shops display waggish signs, reading, “Dogs welcome, people tolerated”, and have treat jars on their counters. The other day, as I was waiting outside a cafe with a friend’s dog, the barista urged me to bring her inside.\n",
    "For years, Britons’ non-partisan passion for animals has been consistent amid dwindling common ground. But lately, rather than bringing out the best in us, our relationship with dogs is increasingly revealing us at our worst – and our supposed “best friends” are paying the price.\n",
    "As with so many latent traits in the national psyche, it all came unleashed with the pandemic, when many people thought they might as well make the most of all that time at home and in local parks with a dog. Between 2019 and 2022, the number of pet dogs in the UK rose from about nine million to 13 million. But there’s long been a seasonal surge around this time of year, substantial enough for the Dogs Trust charity to coin its famous slogan back in 1978: “A dog is for life, not just for Christmas.”\"\"\"\n",
