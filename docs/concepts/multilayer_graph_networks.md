A multilayer graph network is a sophisticated structure used to model complex systems where entities and their interactions can exist in multiple layers, each representing a different type of relationship, context, or domain. Unlike traditional graphs that capture connections in a single, uniform setting, multilayer graphs provide a more nuanced framework, allowing for the representation of diverse interconnections and dependencies across various dimensions or layers.
