            "question": "What does Buck learn from being harnessed and made to work with François?",
            "answer": "Buck learns several important lessons from being harnessed and made to work with François. First, he learns the lesson of obedience and the consequences of disobedience. He quickly realizes that François demands instant obedience and uses his whip to enforce it, and that he must listen and follow commands promptly to avoid the whip [16]. Second, Buck learns the value of hard work and the satisfaction it brings. Despite the new and strange nature of the work, Buck learns quickly and makes remarkable progress, earning respect from François [16][19]. Furthermore, Buck learns important skills related to pulling a sled, such as stopping at command ('ho'), going ahead ('mush'), swinging wide on bends, and staying clear of the wheeler when the sled goes downhill. He also learns the dynamics of working in a team and how to respond to the lead dog's instructions [16][19]."
